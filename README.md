# MovingCircles_Tkinter
Tkinter models of solar system &amp; clock &amp;  firework


## Part1 - Firework

The program should draw circles with random radii in a random place


## Part2 - Clock

- Write a program that displays a 600x600 square window, completely filled with a drawing area.
- A circle with a radius of 200 should be displayed in the center of the area
- Along which circle the point should move clockwise
- Create a variable that sets the speed and direction of movement


## Part3 - Solar System

- There is a stationary sun in the center of the screen.
- Several planets rotate around it in circular orbits at different speeds and at different distances.
- Try adding transparency
- Planets can have their own moons
